# Keyboard-Layout
Designing a perfect keyboard layout. A spreadsheet tool included. <br>
<br>
It is easily shown that the qwerty layout is far from optimal keyboard layout. The most used letters are scattered around the keyboard, and many consecutive used letter pairs are placed on the same finger. Back in the days of mechanical typewriters, this was an advantage - not having too fast typist or the hammers of the keys stuck when hit simultaneously. Today it is only a cause for a repetitive strain injury or a carpal tunnel syndrome, bested only by the mouse. <br>
<br>
This example is optimized for 50% English and 50% Finnish language, but the spreadsheet tool can be fitted to any language and any percentage of weighting. <br>
