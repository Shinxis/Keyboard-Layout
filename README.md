# Keyboard-Layout
Designing a perfect keyboard layout. A spreadsheet tool included. <br>
<br>
The traditional QWERTY computer keyboard is a relic straight from the mechanical typewriter. Today it is a major cause for repetitive strain injury and carpal tunnel syndrome, probably bested only by the mouse. <br>
<br>
The grid of the keyboard is undesirable. It was not designed symmetric hands in mind. None of the keys lie exactly above each other because, back in the days, the typewriter's lever arms were attached to the center of the keys. An ortholinear or columnar split keyboard is the most ergonomic solution, but for laptops and such, even just the layout makes a huge difference. <br>
<br>
The following pictures show the proposals for finger movement in classic Ten-finger system (left) and a new custom layout (right). In the classic system, the left wrist is bent 90Â° to the side, the right hand is almost in the middle of the keyboard, and the right little finger has the most keys. In the new custom layout, the hands move more symmetrically, and the seldomly used keys are located at the harder-to-reach center, where they also can be seen easily. <br>

It is easily shown that the QWERTY keyboard layout is far from optimal. The most used letters are scattered throughout the keyboard, and many recurring letter pairs are placed on the same finger. When the mechanical typewriter was designed this was an advantage - not having too fast typist, or the hammers of the keys stuck when the keys were hit too fast in succession. <br>
<br>
This example is optimized for 50% English and 50% Finnish language, but the spreadsheet tool can be fitted to any language and any weighting percentage. The QWERTY layout performs poorly regardless of the language. The starting point in this layout was the same as in the Dvorak layout; vovels and consonants ar on different hands. <br>
